# DSA - Just for Fun!

Hey there! 👋

This is just a casual little spot where I'm tossing my attempts at some Data Structures and Algorithms problems. The main reason for this repo is so I don't lose my work if my computer decides to go on a permanent vacation. 😅

I'll be pushing new solutions here whenever I get the itch to solve a problem. No schedules, no pressure, just pure fun.

## About Me

I'm just a person who enjoys coding challenges. You can check out my LeetCode profile if you're curious:

## Contributing

Feel free to take a look around! If you have a different way of solving a problem, or just want to suggest something, I'm all ears. Contributions are totally welcome.

Fair warning, though: I might get distracted by a new shiny thing and drop this project at any moment. It's all for the love of the game!

Happy coding!
